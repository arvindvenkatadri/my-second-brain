## Introduction
The course is based on large Human Experiences that can form the basis for **Model-based** Thinking.  

Each of the following Section Titles is an *Abstract Noun* that represents one such **Human Experience**. The understanding of each Human Experience is intended to lead to a Model, in the manner of Charlie Munger and Scott E. Page.  The Human Experience + Model will be, in each case, motivated by contemplating a well known Story, or a Drama, and a Painting. The Models may resemble a Thought Experiment, or a Diagram, or a simple Procedure or Math Formula, or a piece of Computer Code. The Models are intended to provide directions for artistic and design endeavours.

The Models will be understood, internalized, fitted in with what we already know, and generalized to new applications. This will done with the help of activities based on games, videos, art-related activities, open source software tools, field experiments, field visits, additional readings, writings and discussions. 

## Complexity

	-  Use the "Rain" video ( though that does have Central Control...). Can be set up to be an emergent exercise:  
		-  by setting up the three actions ( snapping fingers; slapping the knees; Jumping)  
		-  Rules would be to decide whether or not go to the next action in the sequence, spending 15-20 seconds in each  
		-  Imitate your nearest neighbour  

## Feedback

## Final Course Exercises and Projects

#### Project 1: <u>Orchestral Manoeuvres</u>  ~~in the Dark~~ <u>over Wi-Fi</u>

**Task:** Create an experience to enable **multiple users to simultaneously use hand-phone gestures to create <u>collaborative</u> music/sound**.  Viewers must use dance and/or gestures holding handphones, to create music together . **Each user must be able to control unique aspects of the music** to create a collaborative piece each time. There must be clear opportunities and instructions for <u>collaboration</u> based on a **Stag Hunt / Coordination Game**. 
**Tools:** 
` Software: Pure Data for sound synthesis; Android apps like Sensors2OSC for sensor data logging and sharing over WiFi`
`Hardware: WiFi network hotspot; Smartphones; Laptop or Raspberry Pi running PureData`
**Ideas from our Course:** `Proximity; Game Theory / Stag Hunt; Networks and Graphs`
**Resources:**

#### Project 4: Friends (Season 65, Episode 12)
**Task:** Use this article in the Atlantic Magazine as inspiration: [How friendships in Adulthood ](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/how-friendships-change-over-time-in-adulthood/411466/). Create a physical graph/network related installation, based on personal, or crowd-sourced, or fictitious but plausible friendship data, and show in an interactive way how these friendship networks change over time. Use our collected college network data, and inspiration from <https://graphcommons.com> as  a starting point. Can embed electronic (lights) or computed elements ( touch ) , if desired from an aesthetic point of view or to create/enhance Viewer participation. The installation should show small changes over “time” and must be **wilfully and meaningfully degradable by viewers**. Water, ink, knives, or flame, rubber-bands and oil are possibilities. No acid.
